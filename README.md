## 🚀 Complete Usage Guide

### 1. **Quick Setup**
```bash
# 1. Download the tool
git clone https://github.com/dpiccolomd/neuro-scientific-writer.git
cd neuro-scientific-writer

# 2. Create Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyzotero

# 4. Test installation
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/train_from_zotero.py --setup_help
```

**✅ Ready to use! Now proceed to train the system with your papers.**

### 2. **Train from Your Zotero Library (Recommended)**

**📚 Prepare Your Zotero Library**

Before training, ensure your Zotero library contains neuroscience papers:

1. **Collect 50+ neuroscience papers** in your Zotero library
   - Research articles from journals like Nature Neuroscience, Journal of Neuroscience, etc.
   - Each paper should have PDF attachment for text extraction
   - Papers can be in any collection or in your main library

2. **Optional: Organize in collections**
   - Create collection: "Neuroscience Papers" (or any name you prefer)
   - Drag relevant papers into this collection
   - Or use existing collections like "My Research", "Literature Review"

3. **No special tags or .bib files needed** - the tool works directly with Zotero!

**🔑 Get API Access & Train**

```bash
# Step 1: Get your Zotero API credentials (one-time setup)
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/train_from_zotero.py --setup_help
# Follow the instructions to get your API key and User ID

# Step 2: Set your credentials
export ZOTERO_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export ZOTERO_USER_ID="your_user_id_here"

# Step 3: Train from specific collection
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/train_from_zotero.py --collection "Neuroscience Papers"

# OR train from your entire library (if you have mainly neuroscience papers)
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/train_from_zotero.py --min_papers 50

# This automatically:
# ✓ Connects to your Zotero library via API
# ✓ Downloads PDFs with neuroscience keywords
# ✓ Extracts introduction sections
# ✓ Analyzes writing patterns statistically
# ✓ Creates evidence-based templates
```

### 3. **Manual Training (Alternative Method)**

**If you don't use Zotero or prefer manual PDF collection:**

```bash
# Step 1: Gather research papers manually
mkdir -p data/training_papers
# Put 50+ neuroscience PDF papers in this folder

# Step 2: Build empirical pattern database
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/collect_empirical_data.py --input data/training_papers/
```

**🔬 What this does:**
- Replaces guesswork with real data from published papers
- Creates statistically validated writing patterns
- Learns what actually works in successful publications
- Provides scientific rigor for medical/academic use

### 4. **🔬 Analyze Your Writing with Empirical Patterns**

```bash
# Analyze your introduction using trained patterns
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/analyze_introduction.py --text your_intro.txt --patterns data/empirical_patterns/

# Output example:
# ✅ Based on analysis of 67 papers from your Zotero library:
#   • Optimal paragraph count: 4.3±0.7 (current: 3, recommend: adjust)
#   • Problem-gap-solution structure: Used in 71% of successful papers
#   • Overall quality score: 0.847 (ready for submission: Yes)
```

### 5. **📝 Generate Citation-Integrated Introduction Drafts**

```bash
# NEW: Generate introduction with specific references
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/generate_introduction_with_citations.py \
  --study_title "fMRI Study of Working Memory in Aging" \
  --research_type "experimental_study" \
  --domain "cognitive_neuroscience" \
  --references_collection "Study References" \
  --patterns "data/empirical_patterns/" \
  --output "introduction_draft.md"

# This creates:
# • Complete introduction draft using YOUR specific references
# • Citations integrated contextually throughout the text
# • Quality validation ensuring citation coherence
# • Multiple drafts with different citation strategies
```

### 6. **🔧 Generate Evidence-Based Templates** 

```bash
# Generate template for your specific research
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/generate_template.py --research_type clinical_trial --domain neurosurgery --patterns data/empirical_patterns/

# Creates template with:
# • Structure based on YOUR paper collection
# • Statistical evidence (not assumptions)  
# • Guided variables with examples
# • Journal-specific patterns (if 50+ papers available)
```

### 7. **📋 Quick Reference**
