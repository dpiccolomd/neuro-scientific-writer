- **Generate rigorous templates** based on field-specific methodological standards
- **Create structured introduction drafts** with verified citation contexts
- **Maintain scientific integrity** through comprehensive quality control mechanisms
- **Accelerate manuscript preparation** while preserving academic standards

## 🚀 Complete Usage Guide

### 1. **Quick Setup**
```bash
# 1. Download the tool
git clone https://github.com/dpiccolomd/neuro-scientific-writer.git
cd neuro-scientific-writer

# 2. Create Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyzotero

# 4. Test installation
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/train_from_zotero.py --setup_help
```

**✅ Ready to use! Now proceed to train the system with your papers.**

### 2. **Train from Your Zotero Library (Recommended)**

**📚 Prepare Your Zotero Library**

Before training, ensure your Zotero library contains neuroscience papers:

1. **Collect 50+ neuroscience papers** in your Zotero library
   - Research articles from journals like Nature Neuroscience, Journal of Neuroscience, etc.
   - Each paper should have PDF attachment for text extraction
   - Papers can be in any collection or in your main library

2. **Optional: Organize in collections**
   - Create collection: "Neuroscience Papers" (or any name you prefer)
   - Drag relevant papers into this collection
   - Or use existing collections like "My Research", "Literature Review"

3. **No special tags or .bib files needed** - the tool works directly with Zotero!

**🔑 Get API Access & Train**

```bash
# Step 1: Get your Zotero API credentials (one-time setup)
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/train_from_zotero.py --setup_help
# Follow the instructions to get your API key and User ID

# Step 2: Set your credentials
export ZOTERO_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export ZOTERO_USER_ID="your_user_id_here"

# Step 3: Train from specific collection
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/train_from_zotero.py --collection "Neuroscience Papers"

# OR train from your entire library (if you have mainly neuroscience papers)
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/train_from_zotero.py --min_papers 50

# This automatically:
# ✓ Connects to your Zotero library via API
# ✓ Downloads PDFs with neuroscience keywords
# ✓ Extracts introduction sections
# ✓ Analyzes writing patterns statistically
# ✓ Creates evidence-based templates
```

### 3. **Manual Training (Alternative Method)**

**If you don't use Zotero or prefer manual PDF collection:**

```bash
# Step 1: Gather research papers manually
mkdir -p data/training_papers
# Put 50+ neuroscience PDF papers in this folder

# Step 2: Build empirical pattern database
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/collect_empirical_data.py --input data/training_papers/
```

**🔬 What this does:**
- Replaces guesswork with real data from published papers
- Creates statistically validated writing patterns
- Learns what actually works in successful publications
- Provides scientific rigor for medical/academic use

### 4. **🔬 Analyze Your Writing with Empirical Patterns**

```bash
# Analyze your introduction using trained patterns
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/analyze_introduction.py --text your_intro.txt --patterns data/empirical_patterns/

# Output example:
# ✅ Based on analysis of 67 papers from your Zotero library:
#   • Optimal paragraph count: 4.3±0.7 (current: 3, recommend: adjust)
#   • Problem-gap-solution structure: Used in 71% of successful papers
#   • Overall quality score: 0.847 (ready for submission: Yes)
```

### 5. **📝 Generate Evidence-Based Templates**

```bash
# Generate template for your specific research
PYTHONPATH=./src python scripts/generate_template.py --research_type clinical_trial --domain neurosurgery --patterns data/empirical_patterns/

# Creates template with:
# • Structure based on YOUR paper collection
# • Statistical evidence (not assumptions)  
# • Guided variables with examples
# • Journal-specific patterns (if 50+ papers available)
```

### 6. **📋 Quick Reference**

```bash
# 🆕 ZOTERO TRAINING (One command)

- **Citation Management**: Complete APA formatting for neuroscience journals
- **Quality Control**: Medical-grade validation of generated content
- **Research Modeling**: Detailed project specification system
- **Empirical Framework**: Complete system to learn from real papers

### **🔄 WHAT REQUIRES YOUR DATA:**
The **major improvement** is that we now have empirical pattern detection, but it needs training:

**Old System (Rule-Based):**
- ❌ Based on assumptions and guesswork
- ❌ Hardcoded thresholds 
- ❌ No scientific validation
- ❌ Acknowledged as "naive and terminology-focused"

**New System (Empirical):**
- ✅ **Implementation complete**
- ✅ **Scientific methodology**
- ✅ **Statistical validation**
- ⚠️ **Requires 50+ papers for training**

### **📊 SCIENTIFIC HONESTY:**
- **Pattern Database**: Empty until you collect papers for training
- **Journal Analysis**: Only possible after analyzing 50+ papers per journal
- **Confidence Scores**: Available once empirical patterns are trained
- **Statistical Validation**: Built-in, but needs data to validate against

### **🎯 BOTTOM LINE:**
The tool is **scientifically sound** but needs **your paper collection** to replace assumptions with empirical evidence. The old naive system has been replaced with rigorous methodology - it just needs data to work with.

### **👨‍⚕️ FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS:**
1. **Human Oversight Required**: All output needs expert review
2. **Quality Dependent**: Only as good as your training paper collection
3. **Statistical Claims**: Tool validates against sources, but you verify context
4. **Current Literature**: Ensure training papers are recent and relevant
