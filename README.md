# Neuro-Scientific Writing Assistant 🧠✍️

An AI-powered scientific writing companion specialized in neuroscience/neurosurgery that learns from reference papers to generate structured introduction templates and drafts with **rigorous quality validation** for academic and clinical research.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

**This tool is designed for neuroscience researchers and neurosurgeons who demand the highest standards of academic rigor. All generated content undergoes multiple validation layers and must be manually reviewed before publication.**

## 🎯 Purpose

This tool helps neuroscience researchers and neurosurgeons:
- **Analyze writing patterns** from high-impact neuroscience publications
- **Generate rigorous templates** based on field-specific methodological standards
- **Create structured introduction drafts** with verified citation contexts
- **Maintain scientific integrity** through comprehensive quality control mechanisms
- **Accelerate manuscript preparation** while preserving academic standards

## 🚀 Complete Usage Guide

### 1. **Quick Setup (Tech-Agnostic)**
```bash
# 1. Download the tool
git clone https://github.com/dpiccolomd/neuro-scientific-writer.git
cd neuro-scientific-writer

# 2. Create Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install everything needed
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Test that it works
python examples/empirical_pattern_demo.py
```

**✅ That's it! The tool is ready to use.**

### 2. **Build Scientific Pattern Database (REQUIRED FOR ACCURACY)**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: The tool needs real research papers to learn accurate patterns**

```bash
# Step 1: Gather research papers
mkdir -p data/training_papers
# Put 50+ neuroscience PDF papers in this folder
# Get them from: PubMed, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron, Journal of Neuroscience

# Step 2: Build empirical pattern database
python scripts/collect_empirical_data.py --input data/training_papers/

# This will:
# ✓ Extract text from all PDFs
# ✓ Analyze 50+ introduction structures  
# ✓ Create statistical patterns (NOT assumptions!)
# ✓ Generate confidence intervals
# ✓ Save empirical database
```

**🔬 What this does:**
- Replaces guesswork with real data from published papers
- Creates statistically validated writing patterns
- Learns what actually works in successful publications
- Provides scientific rigor for medical/academic use

### 3. **Generate Your Introduction (Simple Process)**

```bash
# Method 1: Use the demo to see how it works
python examples/empirical_pattern_demo.py

# Method 2: Process your specific research project  
python -c "
# Import the tools
from src.pdf_processor import PDFExtractor
from src.analysis import EmpiricalPatternDetector
from src.template_engine import TargetedTemplateGenerator
from src.citation_manager import APAFormatter

# Define your research (fill in your details)
project_details = {
    'title': 'Your Study Title Here',
    'research_type': 'clinical_trial',  # or observational_study, etc.
    'main_objective': 'What you want to investigate',
    'hypothesis': 'What you expect to find',
    'methods': ['fMRI', 'behavioral_testing'],  # your methods
    'population': 'Who you are studying'
}

# Generate template based on empirical patterns + your research
template_generator = TargetedTemplateGenerator()
template = template_generator.generate_for_project(project_details)

print('Generated introduction template:')
print(template.formatted_introduction)
"
"
```

### 4. **Generate Introduction Draft**

```bash
# For your specific research project
python -c "
# Define your research project
project_info = {
    'research_field': 'cognitive neuroscience',
    'target_phenomenon': 'working memory consolidation', 
    'primary_method': 'functional MRI',
    'key_brain_region': 'prefrontal cortex',
    'broad_field_statement': 'Working memory represents a fundamental cognitive process',
    'hypothesis': 'We hypothesize that PFC-hippocampal interactions facilitate consolidation'
}

# Fill template variables (simplified example)
filled_template = template.sections[0].content_template
for var_name, value in project_info.items():
    filled_template = filled_template.replace(f'{{{var_name}}}', value)

print('Generated introduction draft:')
print(filled_template)
print('\\n⚠️  IMPORTANT: This draft requires manual review and validation!')
"
```

### 5. **Validate Everything (Medical-Grade Quality)**

```bash
# The tool automatically checks:
# ✓ Citation accuracy against source papers
# ✓ Statistical claims validation  
# ✓ Terminology appropriateness
# ✓ Factual consistency
# ✓ Pattern confidence scores

# Run quality validation:
python -c "
from src.quality_control import QualityValidator

validator = QualityValidator()
report = validator.validate_draft(your_text, source_papers)

print(f'Overall Quality: {report.overall_score:.3f}')
print(f'Citation Accuracy: {report.citation_accuracy:.3f}')
print(f'Ready for Submission: {report.overall_score > 0.85}')
"
```

- **Citation Management**: Complete APA formatting for neuroscience journals
- **Quality Control**: Medical-grade validation of generated content
- **Research Modeling**: Detailed project specification system
- **Empirical Framework**: Complete system to learn from real papers

### **🔄 WHAT REQUIRES YOUR DATA:**
The **major improvement** is that we now have empirical pattern detection, but it needs training:

**Old System (Rule-Based):**
- ❌ Based on assumptions and guesswork
- ❌ Hardcoded thresholds 
- ❌ No scientific validation
- ❌ Acknowledged as "naive and terminology-focused"

**New System (Empirical):**
- ✅ **Implementation complete**
- ✅ **Scientific methodology**
- ✅ **Statistical validation**
- ⚠️ **Requires 50+ papers for training**

### **📊 SCIENTIFIC HONESTY:**
- **Pattern Database**: Empty until you collect papers for training
- **Journal Analysis**: Only possible after analyzing 50+ papers per journal
- **Confidence Scores**: Available once empirical patterns are trained
- **Statistical Validation**: Built-in, but needs data to validate against

### **🎯 BOTTOM LINE:**
The tool is **scientifically sound** but needs **your paper collection** to replace assumptions with empirical evidence. The old naive system has been replaced with rigorous methodology - it just needs data to work with.

### **👨‍⚕️ FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS:**
1. **Human Oversight Required**: All output needs expert review
2. **Quality Dependent**: Only as good as your training paper collection
3. **Statistical Claims**: Tool validates against sources, but you verify context
4. **Current Literature**: Ensure training papers are recent and relevant
