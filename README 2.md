```bash
# 1. Download the tool
git clone https://github.com/dpiccolomd/neuro-scientific-writer.git
cd neuro-scientific-writer

# 2. Create Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

**✅ That's it! The tool is ready to use.**

### 2A. **🆕 ZOTERO INTEGRATION: One-Command Training (RECOMMENDED)**

**⚡ NEW: Train directly from your Zotero library!**

```bash
# Step 1: Get Zotero API credentials (one-time setup)
python scripts/train_from_zotero.py --setup_help

# Step 2: Set your credentials
export ZOTERO_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export ZOTERO_USER_ID="your_user_id_here"

# Step 3: Train from Zotero collection (one command!)
python scripts/train_from_zotero.py --collection "Neuroscience Papers"

# This automatically:
# ✓ Downloads 50+ PDFs from your Zotero library
# ✓ Filters for neuroscience papers with citations
# ✓ Extracts introductions and analyzes structures
# ✓ Creates statistical patterns with confidence intervals
# ✓ Preserves metadata and DOIs for verification
```

### 2B. **Manual Training (Alternative Method)**

**If you prefer manual PDF collection:**

```bash
# Step 1: Gather research papers manually
mkdir -p data/training_papers
# Put 50+ neuroscience PDF papers in this folder

# Step 2: Build empirical pattern database
python scripts/collect_empirical_data.py --input data/training_papers/
```

**🔬 What this does:**
- Replaces guesswork with real data from published papers
- Creates statistically validated writing patterns
- Learns what actually works in successful publications
- Provides scientific rigor for medical/academic use

### 3. **🔬 Analyze Your Writing with Empirical Patterns**

```bash
# Analyze your introduction using trained patterns
python scripts/analyze_introduction.py --text your_intro.txt --patterns data/empirical_patterns/

# Output example:
# ✅ Based on analysis of 67 papers from your Zotero library:
#   • Optimal paragraph count: 4.3±0.7 (current: 3, recommend: adjust)
#   • Problem-gap-solution structure: Used in 71% of successful papers
#   • Overall quality score: 0.847 (ready for submission: Yes)
```

### 4. **📝 Generate Evidence-Based Templates**

```bash
# Generate template for your specific research
python scripts/generate_template.py --research_type clinical_trial --domain neurosurgery --patterns data/empirical_patterns/

# Creates template with:
# • Structure based on YOUR paper collection
# • Statistical evidence (not assumptions)  
# • Guided variables with examples
# • Journal-specific patterns (if 50+ papers available)
```

### 5. **📋 Quick Reference**

```bash
# 🆕 ZOTERO TRAINING (One command)

- **Quality Control**: Medical-grade validation of generated content
- **Research Modeling**: Detailed project specification system
- **Empirical Framework**: Complete system to learn from real papers

### **🔄 WHAT REQUIRES YOUR DATA:**
The **major improvement** is that we now have empirical pattern detection, but it needs training:

**Old System (Rule-Based):**
- ❌ Based on assumptions and guesswork
- ❌ Hardcoded thresholds 
- ❌ No scientific validation
- ❌ Acknowledged as "naive and terminology-focused"

**New System (Empirical):**
- ✅ **Implementation complete**
- ✅ **Scientific methodology**
- ✅ **Statistical validation**
- ⚠️ **Requires 50+ papers for training**

### **📊 SCIENTIFIC HONESTY:**
- **Pattern Database**: Empty until you collect papers for training
- **Journal Analysis**: Only possible after analyzing 50+ papers per journal
- **Confidence Scores**: Available once empirical patterns are trained
- **Statistical Validation**: Built-in, but needs data to validate against

### **🎯 BOTTOM LINE:**
The tool is **scientifically sound** but needs **your paper collection** to replace assumptions with empirical evidence. The old naive system has been replaced with rigorous methodology - it just needs data to work with.

### **👨‍⚕️ FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS:**
1. **Human Oversight Required**: All output needs expert review
2. **Quality Dependent**: Only as good as your training paper collection
3. **Statistical Claims**: Tool validates against sources, but you verify context
4. **Current Literature**: Ensure training papers are recent and relevant

## 🤝 Contributing to Medical AI Ethics
