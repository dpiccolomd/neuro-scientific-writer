Empirical Pattern Detection Demo

Demonstrates the improved empirical pattern detection system vs rule-based approach.
Shows how to collect data, train patterns, and use them for analysis.

This addresses the critical limitation identified in our honest assessment:

    Working memory represents a fundamental cognitive process that enables the temporary 
    storage and manipulation of information during complex cognitive tasks. The prefrontal 
    cortex (PFC) has been extensively implicated in working memory functions, with numerous 
    neuroimaging studies demonstrating sustained activation during working memory tasks 
    (Goldman-Rakic, 1995; Curtis & D'Esposito, 2003).
    
    Recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have revealed that 
    working memory involves distributed neural networks rather than localized brain regions. 
    The fronto-parietal network, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and 
    posterior parietal cortex, shows robust activation during working memory maintenance 
    (Owen et al., 2005; Wager & Smith, 2003).
    
    However, the specific mechanisms underlying working memory consolidation remain poorly 
    understood. While previous studies have focused on activation patterns during encoding 
    and retrieval phases, the neural dynamics during the maintenance period have received 
    less attention. This gap in knowledge limits our understanding of working memory disorders.
    
    The present study addresses this limitation by examining PFC-hippocampal connectivity 
    during working memory consolidation using high-resolution fMRI and advanced connectivity 
    analysis. We hypothesize that increased functional connectivity between PFC and 
    hippocampus facilitates successful working memory consolidation.
